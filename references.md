This document lists all the resources and inspirations used in the project "Experiment 5: 3D Graphics" for CMPM 169: Creative Coding.

## Inspirations

1. **Interactive Sphere**
   - **Description**: The project was initially inspired by an interactive sphere that changes as the user interacts with it.
   - **Link**: [Interactive Sphere Example](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/947521)

2. **Base Sphere Code**
   - **Description**: Used as a starting point for simpler sphere manipulation before adding more complex interactions.
   - **Link**: [Basic Sphere Manipulation](https://editor.p5js.org/amcc/sketches/FiN)

3. **Complex Shapes and Interaction**
   - **Description**: Further inspiration for creating complex shapes and interactions within the project.
